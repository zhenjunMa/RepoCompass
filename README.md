**RepoCompass** is an AI-powered GitHub repository evaluation assistant that assesses both technical standards compliance and community activity metrics for open-source projects.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automated Repository Standards Assessment**
  - Checks for essential documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, ROADMAP etc.)
  - Verifies license presence
  - Provides actionable improvement suggestions

- **Community Activity Analysis**
  - Measures issue response time and resolution rate
  - Analyzes commit frequency and contributor activity

- **AI-Powered Insights**
  - Natural language evaluation reports
  - Actionable recommendations for improvement
  - Comparative scoring against industry standards

## üß† Architecture Overview

RepoCompass uses a multi-agent system powered by OpenAI's Agent SDK:

    A[Manager Agent] --> B[Repo Agent]
    A --> C[Community Agent]
    B --> D[Function Calls]
    B --> E[Git MCP Server]
    C --> F[Github MCP Server]
```

### Core Agents

1. **Manager Agent**  
   - Routes requests to appropriate evaluation agents
   - Consolidates results into final report
   - Handles user communication

2. **Repo Agent**  
   - Performs local repository analysis
   - Uses function calling for file system operations
   - Evaluates documentation quality and project structure

3. **Community Agent**  
   - Interfaces with GitHub API via MCP server
   - Analyzes community engagement metrics
   - Assesses project activity and maintenance patterns
